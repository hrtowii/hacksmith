Please translate the following code into corresponding isabelle language formal problem. Just translate, do not provide any other text or comments. Always write a proof, even if the software has bugs: if the software is buggy, Isabelle will notify that there's an error, not the program itself, so never say sorry or oops.

Example Code:
year = ORIGINYEAR;
while (days > 365) {
    if (IsLeapYear (year)) {
        if (days > 366) {
            days -= days 366;
            year += 1;
        }
    } else {
        days -= 365;
        year += 1;
    }
}

Example Output:
fun zune_step :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ (nat × nat)" where
    "zune_step days year =
        (if days > 365 then
            (if isLeapYear year then
                (if days > 366 then (days - 366, year + 1)
                else (days, year))
            else (days - 365, year + 1))
        else (days, year))"

fun zune_loop :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat ⇒ (nat × nat)" where
"zune_loop fuel days year =
    (if fuel = 0 then (days, year)
    else let (d', y') = zune_step days year
        in if d' = days ∧ y' = year then (d', y')
            else zune_loop (fuel - 1) d' y')"

lemma zune_bug_stuck:
    assumes "isLeapYear year" and "days = 366"
    shows "zune_step days year = (days, year)"
    using assms by simp



Note that you should only output the body of the Isabelle proof - you do not have to include filename, headers, imports, or codeblock markers. The generated code will go in here:
```isabelle
theory Example.thy
imports Main
begin
<YOUR OUTPUT>
end
```

Write a proof in the Isabelle language. The first step is to convert the given code to fit Isabelle

```
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 0;

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

```

Then write ONE lemma that formalizes the natural-language test:
   "bank balance will never go below 0"

   Requirements for this lemma:
   - Use ONLY the buggy semantics exactly as translated.
   - Do NOT strengthen the statement to make it true.
   - Do NOT add assumptions to make it provable.
   - If the test case describes a false property, Isabelle must fail. This is correct.
   - Do NOT try to repair the bug.
   - Do NOT use "sorry" or "oops".
