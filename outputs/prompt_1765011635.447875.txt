Please translate the following C code into corresponding isabelle language formal problem. Just translate, do not provide any other text or comments. Always write a correct proof, even if the software has bugs: if the software is buggy, Isabelle will notify that there's an error, not the program itself. Never say sorry 

Example Code:
year = ORIGINYEAR;
while (days > 365) {
    if (IsLeapYear (year)) {
        if (days > 366) {
            days -= days 366;
            year += 1;
        }
    } else {
        days -= 365;
        year += 1;
    }
}

Example Output:
fun zune_step :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ (nat × nat)" where
    "zune_step days year =
        (if days > 365 then
            (if isLeapYear year then
                (if days > 366 then (days - 366, year + 1)
                else (days, year))      (* <-- BUG: no progress when days = 366 *)
            else (days - 365, year + 1))
        else (days, year))"

fun zune_loop :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat ⇒ (nat × nat)" where
"zune_loop fuel days year =
    (if fuel = 0 then (days, year)
    else let (d', y') = zune_step days year
        in if d' = days ∧ y' = year then (d', y')  (* stuck *)
            else zune_loop (fuel - 1) d' y')"

lemma zune_bug_stuck:
    assumes "isLeapYear year" and "days = 366"
    shows "zune_step days year = (days, year)"
    using assms by simp



Note that you should only output the body of the Isabelle proof - you do not have to include filename, headers, imports, or codeblock markers. The generated code will go in here:
```isabelle
theory Example.thy
imports Main
begin
<YOUR OUTPUT>
end
```

Write a proof in the Isabelle language. The first step is to convert the given code to fit Isabelle

```
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 0;

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

```

Without using any context of the provided code, next write a lemma that formally prove that "bank balance will never go below 0". Do not attempt to fix the proof with "sorry" or "oops" even if it can't be proven.
Let Isabelle show an error to the user
